    "text": "1 Introduction\nNumerous pieces of evidence suggest that Earth is experiencing global warming. The Arctic ice is melting. The sea level is rising each year. Temperatures are becoming more extreme, fluctuating from hotter to colder. Additionally, experts predict an imminent depletion of fossil fuels within decades. Researchers from Stanford University forecast the cessation of fossil fuel production by 2052, with reserves running out by 2060. It’s only a matter of time until we exhaust fossil fuels for operating gas cars, necessitating a shift to a more sustainable energy source.\nIn the past decade, electric vehicles have emerged as a new and rapidly growing form of transportation. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the market share of electric vehicle sales surged from 0.17% in 2011 to 4.6% in 2021. Clearly, electric vehicles are gaining popularity over time.\nIt has become commonplace to witness numerous automobile manufacturers, such as Tesla and Hyundai, actively promoting electric vehicles over gas-powered cars. Furthermore, governments worldwide are implementing policies to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles as a climate change mitigation measure. Some governments even provide subsidies, rebates, or tax credits to support the sales of electric vehicles.\nHowever, transitioning from gas cars to electric vehicles still faces significant challenges. A prominent issue frequently discussed by the public is the lack of infrastructure for electric vehicles, notably the scarcity of widely available charging stations and repair centers compared to their gas-powered counterparts. This paper aims to explore the viability of electric vehicles as a sustainable alternative to gas cars, with a specific focus on the accessibility of charging stations in Seoul, South Korea."

However, address information can be converted to street name addresses, and vice versa. A closer examination of entries missing the address column reveals that street name addresses are available and there is no entry where both the address column and street name address column are missing, ensuring no loss of data.\nGas stations still in operation will not have a Date of Closure. Upon closer inspection, out of 1200 missing data entries, 563 gas stations are not currently operating with no Date of Closure. Most of these gas stations were licensed in the late 20th century, suggesting that these data might have been lost due to administrative issues. However, as we will only be using data from the last decade (since EVs were introduced only a decade ago), this loss will not impact our analysis. We observe from the ‘plot_missing’ plot, as expected, that some businesses that opened before 2014 have missing SNAdd. (Street Name Address), while businesses that opened in recent years have missing Add. (Address).\nThus, our data does not contain any missing value that may hinder our analysis."

    "text": "2.2 Research plan\nWe will initially assess the relative accessibility of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in comparison to gas stations. This examination will involve analyzing the density and distribution of both types of fueling infrastructure. Our analysis will take into account factors such as the number of charging ports, charging speed, and the consistent operational status of the stations. This approach aims to provide insights into the practicality and convenience of using electric vehicles in Seoul.\nSubsequently, even though historical data for EV infrastructure is unavailable, we possess historical data for gas stations. This data will be utilized for a longitudinal analysis to uncover trends in accessibility over time. By examining the annual count of operating gas stations, we can discern whether accessibility has improved, worsened, or remained relatively constant throughout the years for gas cars. This information can be utilized to make inferences about the accessibility of EV infrastructure."

    "text": "3.2 Gas Station\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe observe a decline in the number of open gas stations, indicating that more gas stations are closing than new ones are opening. Additionally, there is a consistent downward trend in the annual closure of gas stations. This trend might be attributed to the decreasing annual opening of gas stations, resulting in a decline in closures. The shift in the number of gas stations in Seoul becomes apparent around 2006, and this downward trajectory is more pronounced when examining the lagged plot of newly opened gas stations.\nSeoul has actively promoted various electric vehicle distribution projects, exemplified by the establishment of a dedicated electric vehicle team in 2009. In its 2010 roadmap for green car development, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy outlined plans to produce 1.2 million units and export 900,000 units by 2015, encompassing electric vehicles. Furthermore, in 2011, the Seoul Metropolitan Government unveiled the ‘Seoul Electric Vehicle Master Plan 2014,’ aiming to operate 30,000 electric vehicles, including electric buses, taxis, and passenger cars, in Seoul by 2014. While the data does not definitively establish a causal relationship between the number of gas stations and EV support policies, we suspect that these policies may have directly contributed to the decrease in gas stations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe left plot illustrates a consistent increase in the number of gas stations per 10,000 capita, reaching its peak in 2010. Following this peak, there is a noticeable decline in the number of gas stations per capita, with the exception of an anomaly observed in 2020. This exception could potentially be attributed to a declining population trend over the years, possibly influenced by a low birth rate. The steady decline in the number of gas stations per capita may indicate a broader shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) and an increasing emphasis on alternative energy sources. As the adoption of EVs rises, the demand for traditional fuel stations might decrease, contributing to the observed trend. This shift is more prominently displayed by the graph on the right, which clearly shows the declining trend in the number of gas stations for each district.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$main\n[1] \"Pre 2010\"\n\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"labels\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe survival trajectories of gas stations in Seoul before and after 2010 are clearly different, suggesting a transformative change in the industry. One significant factor we suspect is the rise of electric vehicles (EVs). Governments and consumers have increasingly prioritized clean energy solutions, leading to a potential decline in traditional gasoline-powered vehicles and subsequently affecting the viability of gas stations."
