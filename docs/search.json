    "text": "1 Introduction\nNumerous pieces of evidence suggest that Earth is experiencing global warming. The Arctic ice is melting. The sea level is rising each year. Temperatures are becoming more extreme, fluctuating from hotter to colder. Additionally, experts predict an imminent depletion of fossil fuels within decades. Researchers from Stanford University forecast the cessation of fossil fuel production by 2052, with reserves running out by 2060. It’s only a matter of time until we exhaust fossil fuels for operating gas cars, necessitating a shift to a more sustainable energy source.\nIn the past decade, electric vehicles have emerged as a new and rapidly growing form of transportation. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the market share of electric vehicle sales surged from 0.17% in 2011 to 4.6% in 2021. Clearly, electric vehicles are gaining popularity over time.\nIt has become commonplace to witness numerous automobile manufacturers, such as Tesla and Hyundai, actively promoting electric vehicles over gas-powered cars. Furthermore, governments worldwide are implementing policies to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles as a climate change mitigation measure. Some governments even provide subsidies, rebates, or tax credits to support the sales of electric vehicles.\nHowever, transitioning from gas cars to electric vehicles still faces significant challenges. A prominent issue frequently discussed by the public is the lack of infrastructure for electric vehicles, notably the scarcity of widely available charging stations and repair centers compared to their gas-powered counterparts. This paper aims to explore the viability of electric vehicles as a sustainable alternative to gas cars, with a specific focus on the accessibility of charging stations in Seoul, South Korea."

However, address information can be converted to street name addresses, and vice versa. A closer examination of entries missing the address column reveals that street name addresses are available and there is no entry where both the address column and street name address column are missing, ensuring no loss of data.\nGas stations still in operation will not have a Date of Closure. Upon closer inspection, out of 1200 missing data entries, 563 gas stations are not currently operating with no Date of Closure. Most of these gas stations were licensed in the late 20th century, suggesting that these data might have been lost due to administrative issues. However, as we will only be using data from the last decade (since EVs were introduced only a decade ago), this loss will not impact our analysis. We observe from the ‘plot_missing’ plot, as expected, that some businesses that opened before 2014 have missing SNAdd. (Street Name Address), while businesses that opened in recent years have missing Add. (Address).\nThus, our data does not contain any missing value that may hinder our analysis."

This examination will involve analyzing the density and distribution of both types of fueling infrastructure. Our analysis will take into account factors such as the number of charging ports, charging speed, and the consistent operational status of the stations. This approach aims to provide insights into the practicality and convenience of using electric vehicles in Seoul.\nSubsequently, even though historical data for EV infrastructure is unavailable, we possess historical data for gas stations. This data will be utilized for a longitudinal analysis to uncover trends in accessibility over time. By examining the annual count of operating gas stations, we can discern whether accessibility has improved, worsened, or remained relatively constant throughout the years for gas cars. This information can be utilized to make inferences about the accessibility of EV infrastructure."

    "text": "Charging Stations vs Electric Vehicles per District Plot:\nThis plot also indicates a positive correlation between the number of electric vehicles and the number of charging stations in each district. The positive slope of the line of best fit suggests that districts with more electric vehicles tend to have more charging stations.

There is, however, significant spread around the line of best fit, indicating that the ratio of charging stations to electric vehicles is not consistent across all districts. Some districts may be underserved relative to the number of EVs, while others may have a surplus of charging stations.

    "section": "3.2 Gas Station",
    "text": "3.2 Gas Station\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe observe a decline in the number of open gas stations, indicating that more gas stations are closing than new ones are opening. Additionally, there is a consistent downward trend in the annual closure of gas stations. This trend might be attributed to the decreasing annual opening of gas stations, resulting in a decline in closures. The shift in the number of gas stations in Seoul becomes apparent around 2006, and this downward trajectory is more pronounced when examining the lagged plot of newly opened gas stations.\nSeoul has actively promoted various electric vehicle distribution projects, exemplified by the establishment of a dedicated electric vehicle team in 2009. In its 2010 roadmap for green car development, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy outlined plans to produce 1.2 million units and export 900,000 units by 2015, encompassing electric vehicles. Furthermore, in 2011, the Seoul Metropolitan Government unveiled the ‘Seoul Electric Vehicle Master Plan 2014,’ aiming to operate 30,000 electric vehicles, including electric buses, taxis, and passenger cars, in Seoul by 2014. While the data does not definitively establish a causal relationship between the number of gas stations and EV support policies, we suspect that these policies may have directly contributed to the decrease in gas stations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe left plot illustrates a consistent increase in the number of gas stations per 10,000 capita, reaching its peak in 2010. Following this peak, there is a noticeable decline in the number of gas stations per capita, with the exception of an anomaly observed in 2020. This exception could potentially be attributed to a declining population trend over the years, possibly influenced by a low birth rate. The steady decline in the number of gas stations per capita may indicate a broader shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) and an increasing emphasis on alternative energy sources. As the adoption of EVs rises, the demand for traditional fuel stations might decrease, contributing to the observed trend. This shift is more prominently displayed by the graph on the right, which clearly shows the declining trend in the number of gas stations for each district.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe survival trajectories of gas stations in Seoul before and after 2010 are clearly different, suggesting a transformative change in the industry. One significant factor we suspect is the rise of electric vehicles (EVs). Governments and consumers have increasingly prioritized clean energy solutions, leading to a potential decline in traditional gasoline-powered vehicles and subsequently affecting the viability of gas stations."

We see that as the population gets larger, there seems to be more charging stations suggesting a positive correlation between population and number of charging stations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe color intensity serves as a visual indicator of the ratio of charging stations to the population in each district. Darker shades represent higher accessibility, suggesting a favorable balance of charging infrastructure relative to the population. Notably, districts such as Gangnam-gu and Seocho-gu exhibit deep colors, indicating robust charging station accessibility. These areas appear well-prepared to support the electric vehicle population. Conversely, districts like Nowon-gu and Yangcheon-gu, depicted in lighter colors, indicate comparatively lower accessibility. This suggests a potential need for increased charging station installations to better accommodate the growing demand for electric vehicles in these regions. The heatmap serves as a valuable tool for urban planning, offering insights to guide infrastructure development and enhance the overall viability of electric vehicles across Seoul.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of Charger Model by District: A grouped bar chart showing the count of each charger model in each district. All of the districts show a higher prevalence of Slow charger model and none of the districs have a balanced distribution of slow and fast charger model.This suggests the need of fast model type of charging infrastructure across districts, indicating potential preferences or infrastructure planning.\nAvailability of Rapid Charging Options: A pie chart showing the proportion of charging stations offering rapid charging. The very low percentage of Rapid Charging options(&lt; 1%) suggests the need of focus on providing quick charging solutions in Seoul which will contribute to enhanced accessibility for EV users.\nRelationship Between Operating Institution and Charger Model: A clustered bar chart showing the frequency of each charger model operated by different institutions. This reveals distinct charging model preferences among different operating institutions in Seoul. Notably, the Environmental Ministry exclusively employs fast charging models, suggesting a strategic choice aligned with their goals. In contrast, the Local Government exhibits a mix of fast and slow models, with a preference for fast charging. Other agencies, in general, favor slow models, potentially driven by factors such as cost-effectiveness or specific operational considerations. Moreover, the subset of other agencies that receive subsidies overwhelmingly invests in slow charging models, indicating the influence of financial incentives on charging infrastructure choices. This diversity in preferences underscores the importance of understanding the nuanced factors guiding EV charger model selection among various institutions, with potential implications for infrastructure planning and policy considerations.\nEV Charger Stations’ Facility Classifications in Seoul: This stacked bar chart provides an overview of the facility classifications of EV charger stations across different districts in Seoul.This indicate a significant concentration of EV charger stations within the category of “Apartment Complex Facility” across various districts in Seoul. However, there is a notable scarcity of charging stations in other facilities such as “Educational and Cultural Facility” and “Parking Facility.” This dominance of charger stations in apartment complexes may imply challenges in accessibility for individuals who do not reside in these areas. The limited presence in facilities like educational and cultural establishments or parking facilities suggests potential gaps in accessibility for those who rely on EV charging services outside residential contexts. This insight underscores the importance of strategically expanding charging infrastructure to ensure broader accessibility and convenience for a diverse range of users, addressing potential challenges associated with exclusive reliance on apartment complexes for EV charging needs."

    "text": "From our analysis of gas stations over time, we have even more reason to believe that Electric Vehicles are emerging as the next transportation method. Indeed, based on the analysis, the accessibility of the Electric Vehicle charging stations in Seoul is very accessible. In fact, in some districts, there are more Electric Vehicle chargers than that of number of cars suggesting that the Electric Vehicle infrastructure is keeping pace with, if not surpassing, the increasing demand. The density and distribution of charging stations indicate a robust and well-established EV infrastructure in Seoul. However,a notable inconvenience for EV consumers is the absence of rapid charging stations. The longitudinal analysis of gas stations provides a valuable insights into the energy industry. The trends observed in the consistent decline raise suggests a shift in consumer preference towards electric vehicles, contributing to the gradual decline in gas staions. In conclusion, the evidence suggests that the momentum is firmly in favor of electric vehicles.\nIt is essential to note its limitations. One notable limitation is the absence of historical data specifically dedicated to electric vehicle infrastructure. The reliance on gas station data as a proxy may introduce uncertainties, as the two types of fueling infrastructure may not directly correlate in terms of growth patterns and usage. Additionally, the analysis focused on quantitative aspects such as the number of charging ports and operational status, but qualitative factors like user experience (charging speed), ease of payment, and the availability of amenities were not fully explored. These aspects could significantly impact the perceived accessibility and convenience of EV charging stations. Furthermore, the scope of the study is confined to the city of Seoul, and the findings may not be fully generalizable to regions with different demographic, economic, infrastructural characteristics, or policies.\nOne can consider conducting a more in-depth qualitative analysis focusing on user experiences with EV charging stations. This could involve surveys, interviews, or observational studies to understand factors such as charging speed, ease of payment, and the overall satisfaction of EV users. In addition, one can extend the study to other cities with same demographics and infrastructure characteristics which can provide a broader perspective on the variations in EV infrastructure development.\nWe have come to recognize the pivotal importance of well-managed data sources in our work. In particular, we have found ourselves depending on data from gas stations and utilizing the findings of longitudinal studies as a proxy for comprehending Electric Vehicles. This emphasizes the crucial importance of obtaining precise and reliable data for the purpose of researching and developing impactful policies."
