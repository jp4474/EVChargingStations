    "text": "1 Introduction\nNumerous pieces of evidence suggest that Earth is experiencing global warming. The Arctic ice is melting. The sea level is rising each year. Temperatures are becoming more extreme, fluctuating from hotter to colder. Additionally, experts predict an imminent depletion of fossil fuels within decades. Researchers from Stanford University forecast the cessation of fossil fuel production by 2052, with reserves running out by 2060. It’s only a matter of time until we exhaust fossil fuels for operating gas cars, necessitating a shift to a more sustainable energy source.\nIn the past decade, electric vehicles have emerged as a new and rapidly growing form of transportation. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the market share of electric vehicle sales surged from 0.17% in 2011 to 4.6% in 2021. Clearly, electric vehicles are gaining popularity over time.\nIt has become commonplace to witness numerous automobile manufacturers, such as Tesla and Hyundai, actively promoting electric vehicles over gas-powered cars. Furthermore, governments worldwide are implementing policies to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles as a climate change mitigation measure. Some governments even provide subsidies, rebates, or tax credits to support the sales of electric vehicles.\nHowever, transitioning from gas cars to electric vehicles still faces significant challenges. A prominent issue frequently discussed by the public is the lack of infrastructure for electric vehicles, notably the scarcity of widely available charging stations and repair centers compared to their gas-powered counterparts. This paper aims to explore the viability of electric vehicles as a sustainable alternative to gas cars, with a specific focus on the accessibility of charging stations in Seoul, South Korea."

It furnishes details about the operating organization, address of charging stations, types of charging stations, charging capacities, and more, pertaining to electric vehicle charging stations nationwide in South Korea. This dataset is sourced from the Korea Environment Corporation, a governmental entity under the Ministry of Environment of South Korea. The data was last updated on August 23, 2023, with an unknown update frequency.\nThe second dataset, ‘gas_stations_seoul,’ contains 1,903 rows and 27 columns, offering information about the petroleum sales permit status of gas stations situated in Seoul, South Korea. This dataset is compiled by the Seoul Metropolitan Government and was last updated on November 11, 2023, with an unknown update frequency.\nThe methods employed for data collection remain undisclosed. Since both datasets are in Korean, we plan to utilize either the OpenAPI or GoogleTranslateAPI to translate and preprocess the datasets in Python. This preprocessing involves parsing addresses to extract longitude and latitude and implementing filtering.\nTo access the second dataset, follow this link:\nhttps://www.data.go.kr/data/15119741/fileData.do\nTo access the second dataset, follow this link:\nhttps://data.seoul.go.kr/dataList/OA-16110/S/1/datasetView.do"

However, address information can be converted to street name addresses, and vice versa. A closer examination of entries missing the address column reveals that street name addresses are available and there is no entry where both the address column and street name address column are missing, ensuring no loss of data.\nGas stations still in operation will not have a Date of Closure. Upon closer inspection, out of 1200 missing data entries, 563 gas stations are not currently operating with no Date of Closure. Most of these gas stations were licensed in the late 20th century, suggesting that these data might have been lost due to administrative issues. However, as we will only be using data from the last decade (since EVs were introduced only a decade ago), this loss will not impact our analysis. We observe from the ‘plot_missing’ plot, as expected, that some businesses that opened before 2014 have missing SNAdd. (Street Name Address), while businesses that opened in recent years have missing Add. (Address).\nThus, our data does not contain any missing value that may hinder our analysis."

    "text": "2.2 Research plan\nWe will initially assess the relative accessibility of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in comparison to gas stations. This examination will involve analyzing the density and distribution of both types of fueling infrastructure. Our analysis will take into account factors such as the number of charging ports, charging speed, and the consistent operational status of the stations. This approach aims to provide insights into the practicality and convenience of using electric vehicles in Seoul.\nSubsequently, even though historical data for EV infrastructure is unavailable, we possess historical data for gas stations. This data will be utilized for a longitudinal analysis to uncover trends in accessibility over time. By examining the annual count of operating gas stations, we can discern whether accessibility has improved, worsened, or remained relatively constant throughout the years for gas cars. This information can be utilized to make inferences about the accessibility of EV infrastructure."
